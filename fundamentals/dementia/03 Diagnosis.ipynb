    "To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying poentially treatable condition that may relate to cogniive difficulties. A **physical exam** to measure blood pressure and other vital signs as well as laboratory tests of blood and other fluids to check levels of various chemicals hormones, and vitamins, can help uncover or rule out possible causes of symptoms\n",

To help determine if a person has dementia, a doctor might **compare the size of certain brain regions** to previous scans or to what would be expected for **a person of the same age and size**. Sometimes a CT scan is used when a person isn’t eligible for an MRI due to metal in their body, such as a pacemaker.\n",

Similar to CT scans, MRIs can show whether areas of the brain have atrophied (shrunk). **Repeat scans can show how a person's brain changes over time.** Evidence of shrinkage may support a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or another neurodegenerative dementia but cannot indicate a specific diagnosis.

    "* **Amyloid PET** scans measure abnormal deposits of a protein called beta-amyloid. Higher levels of beta-amyloid are consistent with the presence of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Medical specialists may use amyloid PET imaging to help diagnose Alzheimer’s. A positive amyloid scan may mean symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s or a person is experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer’s. But it’s possible for people to have amyloid plaques and never develop the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, so doctors will consider these findings along with the results of other tests. An amyloid scan that shows just a few or no amyloid plaques usually means that Alzheimer’s is not the cause of the symptoms. These types of scans are often used in research settings to identify those at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and to test potential treatments.\n",

However, thanks to more research advances, improved methods to measure these brain-derived proteins are now available. For example, it is now possible for scientists and some doctors, dependent on state-specific availability reflecting U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, to order a blood test to measure levels of **beta-amyloid.** Several other similar tests are in development.
